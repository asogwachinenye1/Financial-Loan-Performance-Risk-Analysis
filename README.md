# Financial-Loan-Performance-Risk-Analysis
This project analyzes a financial institution's loan dataset to understand how customers borrow, repay, and default on loans. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights that help management make better lending decisions, reduce losses, and approve the right customers.
